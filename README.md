title: Introducing Lanyon
---

Lanyon is a dark theme for websites with simplicity in mind. It's designed for blogging and documentation. Furthermore it has a download section, a contact site and an (empty) Impress. BlackSite is based on [BlackDoc](https://github.com/karloespiritu/BlackDoc).

I was in need of a jekyll theme for my [website](https://ma744.github.io). In order to get one that fits to my purposes I forked [BlackDoc](https://github.com/karloespiritu/BlackDoc).


### BlackDoc

[BlackDoc](https://github.com/karloespiritu/BlackDoc) is a two-column [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that's ideal for websites that require a master-detail layout for viewing of content. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler, and the [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com) theme.

[BlackDoc](https://github.com/karloespiritu/BlackDoc) is made by [Karlo Espiritu](http://karloespiritu.com), who customised the theme to make it look great in black background and changed the sidebar to display scrolling content.

### Built on Poole

 Poole is the Jekyll Butler, serving as a foundation for creating Jekyll themes. Poole-based themes, such as BlackDoc here, include the following:

 * Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [404](/404), [RSS feed](/atom.xml), posts, and [example page](/about))
 * Mobile friendly design and development
 * Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
 * Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
 * Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
 * Syntax highlighting using Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)

### Lanyon Features

In addition to the features of [Poole](http://getpoole.com), [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com), and [BlackDoc](https://github.com/karloespiritu/BlackDoc), Lanyon theme adds the following:

* Redirect links
* A simple protection against bots for your e-mail
* Placed some fonts offline at /public/css/fonts; there is no need to call googleapis.com
* Adds new page layouts
* Customized sidebar for 'extra pages' like impress
* more meta tags in the head.html file

Check out the `Readme` of [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) and [BlackDoc](https://github.com/karloespiritu/BlackDoc) theme to learn more about the features.

### Download

Lanyon is a free Jekyll theme and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/ma744/Lanyon">GitHub repository</a> to download.


### Fun fact

Lanyon, Hyde, Poole and Jekyll are characters of Robert L. Stevenson's story "The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde".

I would appreciate leaving a 'credit link' at your website when using the Lanyon Theme.
